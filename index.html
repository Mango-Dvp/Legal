Giving me time to help you is much better than getting angry or leaving mean comments in public spaces." },

This means I can focus on what our community needs instead of what a big company wants from us." },

This helps the whole community grow by sharing the best ideas from all of our smart users." },

This is part of my promise to give you control over your own digital footprint while you are here." },

I will always do my best to get things running again once the big problem has been solved." },

I keep these rules updated to make sure you are always protected and that the project stays safe." },

My goal is to make sure the majority of users have a smooth experience without any lag or errors." },

If I see you selling access to my tools, I will shut down your access without any warning." },

Continuing to use the tools after a rule change means you agree with the new rules completely." },

I value your privacy, and I only look at what is needed to make the system work for your server." },

This is a standard safety feature that helps me keep the entire system running fast and clean." },

I work together with these platforms to make sure the internet stays a safe place for everyone." },

I only provide links to help you find information, but I cannot control what those other sites do." },

These are just our rules for using the tools, and if you have a big legal question, you should talk to a real lawyer. I am here to build code and help the community, but I am not a legal professional." },

I want to protect my community and my hard work from people who do not want to follow the rules." },

If you try to bypass these limits, you might be temporarily blocked from using the tools." },
